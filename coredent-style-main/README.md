# 🚀 Production App Master Checklist (Launch Playbook)

## 1️⃣ PRODUCT & UX REALITY
- **User Flows** – design and document ALL flows:
  - Signup / Login / Logout
  - Forgot password / Change password
  - Delete account (mandatory)
  - Email verification
  - Phone verification (OTP)
  - Profile edit
  - Empty, Loading, Error, Offline states
- **Edge‑case UX** – handle:
  - Back‑button spam, double taps
  - Slow / intermittent internet
  - Interrupted payments, app closed mid‑task
  - Landscape mode, accessibility (large fonts, screen readers)

## 2️⃣ AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY 🔐
- **Login methods** – support:
  - Email/password
  - Google OAuth
  - Apple Sign‑In (mandatory for iOS)
  - Phone OTP (optional but recommended)
- **Security basics** – implement:
  - Strong password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
  - JWT or server‑side session with refresh tokens
  - Token expiration & revocation
  - Account lockout after repeated failed attempts
  - Email verification before access
  - Rate limiting on login/registration endpoints
- **Advanced security** – ensure:
  - Protection against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
  - Secure HTTP headers (HSTS, CSP, X‑Frame‑Options, etc.)
  - Secrets management via environment variables / vault
  - Role‑based access control (RBAC) and least‑privilege permissions

## 3️⃣ DATABASE & BACKEND DESIGN 🧠
- **Schema planning** – proper tables, relationships, indexes, and migrations
- **Data strategies** – backups, point‑in‑time restores, archiving, soft‑delete vs hard‑delete
- **Compliance** – GDPR/CCPA data‑deletion requests, data‑retention policies

## 4️⃣ ERROR HANDLING & RESILIENCE 🔥
- Graceful degradation for server downtime, API failures, third‑party outages
- Retry mechanisms with exponential back‑off
- User‑friendly error UI (“Something went wrong”) instead of crashes

## 5️⃣ ANALYTICS & USER TRACKING 📊
- **Product analytics** – sign‑ups, onboarding drop‑offs, feature usage, session length, retention, conversion funnels
- **Tools** – Firebase Analytics, PostHog, Mixpanel, etc.
- **Error monitoring** – Sentry, Crashlytics, or similar

## 6️⃣ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION ⚡
- Lazy loading, pagination, image compression, CDN for static assets
- Query optimization, API caching, background jobs, debouncing/throttling

## 7️⃣ STATE MANAGEMENT 🧩
- Global state architecture (Redux, Zustand, React Query, etc.)
- Data caching strategy and background sync

## 8️⃣ OFFLINE & POOR NETWORK SUPPORT 📶
- Retry failed requests, offline caching, sync on reconnection, offline indicators

## 9️⃣ PUSH NOTIFICATIONS 🔔
- Permission flow UX, token management, segmentation, scheduling, deep linking, quiet hours, unsubscribe handling

## 🔟 PAYMENTS (IF ANY) 💳
- Full payment lifecycle: success, failure, pending, refunds, chargebacks, duplicate prevention
- Secure webhook handling, invoice generation

## 1️⃣1️⃣ APP STORE / PLAY STORE LAUNCH 📱
- Store assets: icons, screenshots (multiple sizes), promo video
- ASO: description, keywords, screenshots
- Policies: privacy‑policy URL, terms‑of‑service, data‑safety form, age restrictions, account‑deletion option

## 1️⃣2️⃣ LEGAL & COMPLIANCE ⚖️
- Privacy policy, terms of service, cookie policy (web)
- GDPR/CCPA compliance, data‑retention, age restrictions, email unsubscribe compliance

## 1️⃣3️⃣ DEVOPS & DEPLOYMENT 🚀
- CI/CD pipelines: automated testing, builds, deployments
- Separate environments: dev, staging, production
- Rollback strategy, feature flags, hot‑fix pipeline

## 1️⃣4️⃣ TESTING 🧪
- Unit, integration, end‑to‑end, device, load, security testing
- Automated test coverage thresholds

## 1️⃣5️⃣ MONITORING & ALERTS 🚨
- Alerts for server downtime, API latency spikes, payment failures, crash‑rate increase
- Tools: Datadog, NewRelic, Grafana, Prometheus

## 1️⃣6️⃣ SCALING PREPARATION 📈
- Horizontal scaling, load balancers, CDN, queue systems (Redis, RabbitMQ)
- Micro‑service readiness

## 1️⃣7️⃣ CUSTOMER SUPPORT 💬
- Help center/FAQ, contact support, feedback system, bug reporting, admin dashboard

## 1️⃣8️⃣ ADMIN PANEL (ALMOST ALWAYS MISSING) 👑
- User management, analytics view, ban/suspend, report handling, notifications, log access

## 1️⃣9️⃣ GROWTH & RETENTION 📣
- Referral system, email campaigns, re‑engagement notifications, A/B testing, feature nudges

## 2️⃣0️⃣ POST‑LAUNCH REALITY 😅
- Ongoing bug fixing, feature requests, architectural evolution, continuous iteration
