"""Verify the Celery beat schedule is actually runnable by the worker.

Catches two silent-failure modes, both of which leave a scheduled job never
running while every log line still looks healthy:

1. A beat entry naming a task that nothing registers.
2. A scheduled task routed to a queue the worker does not consume - Celery
   publishes it and it then sits in the broker forever.

This matters more than it looks: a background job that never fires is invisible.
It is the same class of defect as the retention purge that raised NameError on
every run for months because nothing observed the failure.

Exits non-zero on a problem so CI fails, rather than printing a finding that
nobody reads.
