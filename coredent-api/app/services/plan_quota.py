"""
Plan limit (quota) enforcement.

Plans carry a JSON ``limits`` map such as ``{"patients": 1000, "users": 10}``
(see ``SubscriptionPlan.limits``).  This module exposes a FastAPI dependency
that rejects resource-creation once the practice's current subscription plan
has been exhausted for a dimension, so a plan limit is something the product
actually enforces and not just a number stored in the plan row.

Design rules
------------
* Additive and safe: enforcement only ever *adds* a 403. If there is no
  current subscription, no plan, the plan has not configured a limit for the
  requested dimension, or the limit is negative (unlimited), access is
  granted. Existing trial/legacy accounts behave exactly as before.
* Guided by the real subscription row: the same "is the subscription current"
  policy that gates app access (``deps._subscription_is_current``) decides
  whether a plan's limits apply, so a PAST_DUE/CANCELED account is not quota-
  blocked in a transient way that would compound its own recovery.
* Counted from live data, never from the plan defaults: ``patients`` and
  ``users`` are counted per practice at request time so over-quota writes are
  rejected with current numbers.
