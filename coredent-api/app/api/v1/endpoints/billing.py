CRUD operations for invoices and payments

SECURITY HISTORY
----------------
- 2026-02: Replaced the read-then-write invoice-number generation (which
  was racy under concurrent requests and would cause a 500 on the
  ``unique=True`` constraint) with a Postgres advisory lock so two
  concurrent requests serialize.
- 2026-02: Wrapped the payment-creation + invoice-status transition in
  a ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` on the invoice row so two concurrent
  payments for the same invoice cannot both observe ``balance_due > 0``
  and over-pay.

    The ledger already carries `refunded_amount` and the summary math
    subtracts it (`amount_paid` is net of refunds), but there was no
    server-side path to *create* a refund — clinics could only cancel an
    invoice or record new money. This closes that gap.

    Guarantees (mirroring POST /payments/):
    - Row locks the payment AND its invoice for the whole transaction so a
      concurrent payment and refund cannot interleave.
    - Never refunds more than the payment's remaining refundable balance.
    - Never takes the invoice's net collected amount below zero.
    - Recomputes both the payment status (REFUNDED / PARTIALLY_REFUNDED)
      and the invoice status (PARTIALLY_PAID / PENDING) from the ledger.
    - Full audit trail: who refunded how much of which payment, and why.
