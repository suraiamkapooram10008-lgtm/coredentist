"""Durable ledger of payment-processor webhook events.

Audit finding C-01: the Stripe webhook marked an event as processed in Redis
*before* invoking the handler, and the payment handler only ever *updated* an
existing ``PaymentTransaction``. When no local row matched the incoming
``payment_intent``, the webhook still answered 200 -- so a real, successful
external payment could be acknowledged with nothing recorded anywhere.

Two things fix that: releasing the dedup marker on handler failure (so
retries are reprocessed), and this table (so an event that can never be
mapped to a tenant is still recorded rather than silently dropped).

The invariant this table enforces: **we only answer 200 to a processor after
the event is durably recorded.** Either it produced a ``PaymentTransaction``,
or it is sitting here as ``UNRECONCILED`` waiting for an operator.

It also provides database-backed idempotency as a second line of defence
behind Redis: ``event_id`` is unique, so a replayed event cannot be applied
twice even if Redis has been flushed.

PHI: the raw processor payload is deliberately NOT stored. Only an
allowlisted set of non-clinical routing fields is persisted (see
``app.services.processor_events.summarize_event``).
