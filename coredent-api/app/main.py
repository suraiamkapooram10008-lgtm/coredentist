# documents the intended always-on contract) and a misconfigured deploy could
# silently lose HSTS/CSP. The headers are inert outside HTTPS and the CSP
# allow-lists exactly the third-party origins the frontend needs:
#   - https://js.stripe.com    -> Stripe.js for payments
#   - https://*.sentry.io      -> Sentry error reporting + tracing

# If you add another service, add its origin here AND audit the
# implication for PHI exfiltration.
# SECURITY: Removed 'unsafe-inline' from script-src and style-src.
# Previously allowed because some inline scripts slipped in, but
# 'unsafe-inline' effectively disables the XSS protection CSP
# provides and is a HIPAA control failure for a SaaS that handles
# PHI.  Vite emits non-hashed, non-nonced scripts; add a nonce
# or hash to any legitimate inline script before reintroducing it.
# Same applies to style-src (most inline style is from React/emotion
# and can be refactored to class names).
# L-3 FIX: removed https://cdn.jsdelivr.net from script-src — the frontend
# vendors everything into hashed local assets and nothing loads scripts from
# jsDelivr (verified across src/, index.html and the built bundle); keeping a
# general-purpose CDN in script-src only adds supply-chain exposure.
