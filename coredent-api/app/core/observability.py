"""Sentry initialization and Prometheus metrics, shared by every process role.

Two gaps this module closes:

1. Sentry was initialized in ``app/main.py``, which only the web process
   imports. Workers and beat never called ``sentry_sdk.init()``, so every
   ``capture_exception`` inside a Celery task was a silent no-op: background
   failures (email delivery, rate-limit backend loss, a wedged sweep) left no
   trace beyond the container log.
2. ``prometheus_client`` was installed and ``/metrics`` existed, but not a
   single application metric was defined, so the endpoint exposed only the
   default process/GC collectors and nothing was alertable.

Initialization is deliberately role-agnostic: every integration is attached
when its library is importable, and ``role`` is only a tag. ``app.core.celery_app``
and ``app.main`` both call :func:`init_sentry`, and which one wins the import
race depends on the process, so keying integrations off the role would make
behaviour depend on import order.
