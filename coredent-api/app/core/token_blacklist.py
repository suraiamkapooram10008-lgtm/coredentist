Token Revocation (Access-Token Blacklist)
=========================================

When a user logs out, their *refresh* token session is deleted from the DB,
preventing new access tokens from being minted.  However, the current access
token (short-lived, default 15 min) remains valid until it expires.

For defense-in-depth — particularly HIPAA session management — we maintain a
**revocation set**.  On logout, the access token's ``jti`` (JWT ID) is
recorded with a TTL equal to the remaining token lifetime.  On every
authenticated request, ``get_current_user`` checks the set and rejects revoked
tokens.

H-01 FIX — why there are two stores
-----------------------------------
This module used to keep revocations in Redis with an in-process ``deque``
fallback. Two problems:

1. The deque is per-worker. A revocation written by worker A was invisible to
   worker B.
2. On a Redis error, ``is_revoked`` returned ``jti in _fallback`` — so a
   revoked token kept authenticating on every worker whose local deque did not
   contain that jti. Revocation failed **open**.

Simply failing closed on Redis errors is not acceptable either: it would
reject every authenticated request during any Redis blip.

So revocation is now durable. ``revoke_token`` writes the ``revoked_tokens``
table (authoritative, shared, transactional) *and* Redis (a cache).
``is_revoked`` reads Redis first and falls through to the database when Redis
is unavailable. Correctness no longer depends on Redis; neither does
availability, because the database is already on the request path.

The in-process set is retained only as a same-process write-through cache for
the window between a write and its visibility; it is never the sole authority.
