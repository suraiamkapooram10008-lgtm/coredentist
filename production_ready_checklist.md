# 🛡️ CoreDent PMS - Production Readiness Checklist

**Date:** March 15, 2026

## 1. Security & Environment
- [x] **Secure Environment Variables**: Verified that no secrets are in the frontend build.
- [x] **HTTPS Enforcement**: Backend has `HTTPSRedirectMiddleware` and HSTS headers.
- [x] **Protected Routes**: All sensitive frontend pages are behind `ProtectedRoute`.
- [x] **API Key Encryption**: Sensitive database fields are encrypted with Fernet.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Need to tighten limits on `/login` (Fix below).

## 2. Infrastructure & Operations
- [x] **Logging**: Sentry is integrated in both frontend and backend.
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Tracking data reads (PHI access) is still missing.
- [x] **Error Messaging**: Production backend hides internal tracebacks.
- [x] **Dockerized**: Both services have production-ready Dockerfiles.

## 3. Dependency Check
- [x] **Vulnerability Scan**: `pip-audit` and `npm audit` run.
- [ ] **Outdated Packages**: `fastapi` and `sqlalchemy` need updates.
